### Loading Local Data

If you are trying to pick a file from your physical hard drive, you cannot browse your local folders through the Java window. You must use the bridge upload feature.

1. Look at the very top right of the Java window's title bar for a small **Up Arrow (Upload)** button.
2. Click it to trigger your **native browser file picker** (this one can see your real computer folders).
3. Select your local file. The app will silently drop it into the virtual folder named `/files/uploads/`.
4. Now, inside your Java file picker, type `/files/uploads/` into the file path bar and press **Enter** to find your uploaded file.
